# Word-Guess-Game

This word guessing game was my first application using Javascript. <br>
It encompasses all I've learned in the first few weeks of bootcamp. 
It consists of **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**

I decided upon a theme of mythical creatures for this game. <br>

There are a total of 3 pages and each page have got click events for the user to interact with.
Pages are as followed:
1. The first page welcomes the user and provides the rules for the game
- pick a letter every turn until word is guessed
- you have 5 incorrect letters before you lose
- each correct word will grant you a point
- click enter to begin
2. The second page displays a unicorn background and prompts the user to hit Okay to begin<br>

3. The third page shows blank spaces and an on-screen keyboard for the user to guess letters
- the keys are coded in javascript to collect the user's input and reveal the result after
- following an incorrect guess, the screen will display the number of guesses have decreased
- following a correct guess, the blank spaces will be filled accordingly with those letters
- button that allows the user to choose a new word will be displayed when:<br>
the user wins (a point will be added to the onscreen score)<br>
OR the user loses (the user can continue to guess that same word as well)
- there's also a maplestory sound that plays following a win ^_^
